# Tailwind CSS Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS. A simple component is not rendering as expected; the text is cut off, and the background color is not applied correctly.  The issue appears to be related to the interaction of Tailwind classes and potentially some unexpected CSS specificity or conflict.

## Bug Description

The provided component should display a nicely formatted div with a gray background, some padding, and clear text. Instead, the text is cut off, and the background color isn't applied consistently. This behavior seems to be sporadic and related to the specific combination of classes used.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the CSS specificity and potential conflicts with other styles. It may involve adjusting the order of classes, adding important! to critical declarations, or using more specific selectors to ensure the Tailwind styles are applied correctly.
